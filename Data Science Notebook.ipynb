    "## Arithmetic Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic expressions are mathematical expressions that involve basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They are commonly used in programming to perform calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of arithmetic expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Addition: `5 + 3` equals 8\n",
    "2. Subtraction: `10 - 4` equals 6\n",
    "3. Multiplication: `2 * 7` equals 14\n",
    "4. Division: `15 / 3` equals 5\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use parentheses to control the order of operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `(4 + 2) * 3` equals 18 (first add 4 and 2, then multiply by 3)\n",
    "- `8 / (2 + 2)` equals 2 (first add 2 and 2, then divide 8 by the result)\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that arithmetic expressions follow the usual rules of mathematics, including operator precedence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming languages like Python, you can use these arithmetic expressions within variables, functions, and more complex calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try experimenting with different arithmetic expressions to gain a better understanding of how they work!\n"
